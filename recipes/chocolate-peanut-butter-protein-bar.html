    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate peanut butter protein bars are easy to make in a small batch, and absolutely delicious.
        Using a good protein powder is the key. If there is a downside, it might be how hard it will be to only eat one.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup peanut butter</li>

        <li>1/2 cup vanilla protein powder</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Place chocolate chips and oil in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds, stir. Repeat until chips are completely melted when stirred.
